## ‚ùì Research Questions

The project explored the following key questions to uncover actionable business insights:

1. **How does revenue generated by different product categories (e.g., Food, Disposables, Grooming) fluctuate across seasons?**
2. **How does revenue vary across regions and states, and are there specific product categories that perform better in certain areas?**
3. **What is the correlation between product category, landed cost, and quantities sold?**
4. **What is the average landed cost versus shipping cost per order, and how does this vary by region or product type?**
5. **Does the current revenue model follow the Pareto Principle (i.e., does 80% of revenue come from 20% of the categories/products)?**
6. **How do sales and profit trends, product category performance, and regional revenue distribution shape Munchy‚Äôs business strategy, and what insights can be derived to optimize growth and profitability?**

## üîç Insights & Recommendations

### üì¶ Product-Level Insights

- **Dog Food and Disposables emerged as the most consistent revenue generators** across all seasons. Dog Food alone accounted for nearly 35% of total revenue, maintaining strong sales year-round with a peak in December.
- **Disposables displayed the most efficient cost-to-sales ratio**, with low landed cost and exceptionally high quantities sold. This indicates they are essential, high-frequency items that should be prioritized in stock planning and bundled offers.
- **Electronics and Supplements underperformed**, with high landed costs but minimal sales volume. These categories may suffer from overpricing or lack of product visibility. Strategic action is needed to either reposition these products, improve their perceived value, or replace them with more in-demand alternatives.

### üõç Regional and Seasonal Performance

- **California, Texas, and Florida were identified as the top-performing states**, contributing over 40% of total sales. The East and Central regions also showed significant profitability.
- Seasonal analysis showed that **Fall and Winter were peak periods** for revenue generation, particularly for categories like Dog Food and Disposables. This seasonality should inform marketing calendar planning, stock levels, and discount campaigns.

### üì¶ Cost Structure & Supply Chain Efficiency

- **Landed cost and shipping cost are heavily impacted by product weight**, especially in categories like Pet Food. While Pet Food sells well, its high shipping cost can erode profit margins.
- **Electronics, though lightweight, had relatively high shipping costs**, potentially due to fragile handling requirements and expedited delivery options. Packaging optimization and vendor negotiations may help reduce costs.
- The scatter plot analysis revealed an **inverse relationship between landed cost and quantity sold**, reinforcing the importance of balancing cost efficiency with demand generation.

### üìä Pareto Principle Validation

- The analysis confirmed the **Pareto Principle**, with the top 3 product categories (Dog Food, Disposables, Grooming) contributing 74.3% of total revenue.
- Similarly, **a small subset of products (top 4 SKUs)** generated over 40% of the store‚Äôs revenue, indicating a clear opportunity to concentrate marketing, inventory, and promotional strategies around these top performers.

### ‚úÖ Strategic Recommendations

1. **Double down on high-performing products** like Dog Food and Disposables with targeted promotions, auto-refill subscriptions, and upsell bundles.
2. **Reevaluate or reprice underperforming categories** like Electronics and Supplements; consider replacing them with more essential, consumable items.
3. **Develop seasonal campaigns** around Q4, leveraging high demand in Fall and Winter with timely inventory restocking and discount strategies.
4. **Optimize shipping strategy** by:
   - Reducing landed costs through supplier negotiations
   - Bundling heavier products to dilute shipping cost per unit
   - Exploring regional fulfillment centers for high-volume states
5. **Promote cross-category bundles** (e.g., Grooming + Disposables) to boost sales of lower-performing but essential products.
6. **Visualize and track KPIs monthly** to ensure revenue contribution is improving across the bottom 50% of products.
